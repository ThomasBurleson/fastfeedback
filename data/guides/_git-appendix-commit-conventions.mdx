### <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Conventions

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

:::danger
To enforce _commit conventions_, the following tooling will be used:

- [Husky Pre-commit Hooks](https://github.com/typicode/husky), and
- [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

Watch the Egghead [Video: Using Commitizen](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-writing-conventional-commits-with-commitizen) for details.
:::

#### Commit Message Format

```xml
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.

- The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**. The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
- The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

:tada: We use the git commit messages to generate **release notes**: [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

#### Message Parts

```xml
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

<br />

##### `<Type>`

Must be one of the following:

| Option       |     | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **build**    | üíé  | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)    |
| **ci**       | üôå  | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)    |
| **docs**     | üìö  | Documentation only changes                                                                             |
| **feat**     | üéâ  | A new feature                                                                                          |
| **fix**      | ü¶Ç  | A bug fix                                                                                              |
| **perf**     | ‚è≥  | A code change that improves performance                                                                |
| **refactor** |     | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                              |
| **style**    |     | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| **test**     |     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                      |

<br />

##### `<Scope>`

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes for this _use package name_ rule:

|                  |                    |                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **animations**   | **css**            | **ui**               |
| **common**       | **shared**         | **core**             |
| **dataservices** | **forms**          | **http**             |
| **router**       | **service-worker** | **state-management** |

There are currently a few exceptions to the _use package name_ rule:

- **packaging**: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages,
  - e.g. public path changes,
  - package.json changes done to all packages,
  - d.ts file/format changes,
  - changes to bundles,
  - etc.
- **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\[target=\_blank]
- **none/empty string**: useful for `style`, `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all packages, and for docs changes that are not related to a specific package.
  - `style: add missing semicolons`
  - `docs: fix typo in tutorial`

<br />

##### `<Subject>`

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

<br />

##### `<Body>`

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

:::info
**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message body is then used for this information.
:::

<br />

##### `<Footer>`

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

<br />

---

#### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
