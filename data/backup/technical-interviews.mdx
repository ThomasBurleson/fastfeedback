# Guideline: Technical Interviews

<br />

<Image src={`/static/images/technical-interviews/JorgPEH.png`} alt={``} width={1605} height={422} />

<br />

Before accpetance/hiring, each candidate should complete three (3) phases of the interview process:

1.  **Email**: <u>Resume Qualification</u> and Skill Self-Assessment
2.  **Remote**: <u>Technical Phone Interview</u> and Code Pairing
3.  **Onsite**: Onsite <u>Behavior Interview</u> and Team Collaboration

Even with diligent technical recruiters, an interview process can be easily flooded with invalid, inappropriate, and time-wasting resumes.

For companies with open roles, the most expensive part of the interview process is the '<u>onsite interview</u>' phase... as this impacts the entire hiring team.

As such, using a 3-Phased approach will improve the efficacy of the interview and quickly filter only candidates with the appropriate skills and experience. Optimize the 'cost of interviewing' by quickly and accurately validating candidates.

<br />

:::success
Regardless of the open role (eg Designer, Developer, QA, or Product Owner), a **3-Phased Interview** approach dramatically increases hire acceptance rates, hire confidence, and post-hire success.

### 1) Resume & Self-Assessment

:::danger
Often candidate resumes will not have been properly qualified by the recruiter.
:::

The resume should clearly list the **experience and skills** matching the positions requirements. Additionally, each open role should be associated with a minimum # of projects + years of experience.

<Image src={`/static/images/technical-interviews/mWmakpk.png`} alt={``} width={1934} height={554} />

> For <u>Interns</u> or Beginner roles, the resume should list their training/education and possible internships.

If the candidate's resume matches the role requirements then a Phone Interview should be scheduled. And the candidate should be emailed a link to a **Technical Self-Assessment** (TSA) document; to be completed <u>before</u> interview. The TSA will ask the developer to (a) self-assess and self-rank their experience/knowledge and (b) submit the results.

The candidate should be warned that the TSA rankings will be used to determine difficulty level of the technical questions that will be asked during the phone interview.

:::warning
With this warning, candidates will be more considerate in their self-assessment since their answers will directly impact them during the interview.
:::

<br />

#### Technical Self-Assessment

The Technical Self-Assessment (TSA) will be comprised of 2..n sections; each section will contain a list of skill or experience types. And each list item will provide an interactive rating with a scale range of 1 to 8 (see above).

<br />

The self-assessment results (see sample above ^) provide metaphorical 'aerial' maps for the interviewer to both (a) assess the skill gaps and (b) test the professed skill/experience areas.

Below are links to developer <u>assessment documents</u> for several technology platforms:

- [Self-Assessment for Javascript Developers](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/Hy6fjgp8I)
- [Self-Assessment for Angular Developers](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/Hy6fjgp8I#Angular-Developer)
- [Self-Assessment for React Developers](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/Hy6fjgp8I#React-Developer)
- Self-Assessment for Java Developers

The self-assessment also provides interviewers several insights for the technical interview:

- provides a starting point for technical questions
- provides a broad-band view ('aerial map') of the developers' skills, strengths, and weaknesses
- allows the interviewer to evaluate the accuracy of the developer's profressional self-image

### 2) 'Technical' Phone Interview

The phone interview enables candidates to be quickly validated from a technical perspective. The conversation should be collaborative and focused on a reasonable, candid assessment of the candidates skills, weaknesses, and possible 'red' flags.

<Image src={`/static/images/technical-interviews/avf1n3u.png`} alt={``} width={649} height={220} />

<br />

The phone interview actually has three (3) sections:

- **Technical Questions** based on the candidates self assessment (TSA)
  > The selection of questions should be based on the TSA submissions. Be reasonable and try to make this fun. If needed, guide the candidate to solutions with hints; do not give away answers.
- Easy **Code Challenges**: request guided code refactorings to small code samples that have 1-n issues.
  > These should be reasonable online samples that can be refactored/discussed within 15 minutes each. Use CodePen.io, CodeSandbox.io, or StackBlitz.com.
- Candidate **Code Presentations**: code written by candidate that represents their skills, focus on quality, and pride.
  > This part of the interview is optional and allows the candidate to 'shine' with their own work. To ensre the ownership of the presented code, interviewers should ask reasonable questions regarding architectures, intent, and dynamically detect any code issues (if present).

<br />

#### <u>Technical Questions</u>

The intent of these questions is to validate the skill levels of the candidate \[as expressed by the candidate]. Based on the TSA rating for a category, the interview will present a question that should be reasonable for a developer to answer... for a develper at the professed skill/experience level.

<br />

:::success
Hints can be provided to guide developers to answers if they are struggling.
:::

As the candidate answers each question, the interview may elect to ask another more difficult question (within the same category). The goal is to identify weak areas, explore how the candidate explores unknown areas, how the candidate responds to uncomfortable questions.

:::info
The _question process_ (and the difficulty escalation) should be described to the candidate at the beginning of the phone interview. This transparency provides the candidate some understanding and expectation as the question 'difficulty' increases.
:::

**Technical questions** are available below for several technologies and platforms:

- [Technical Questions - **Javascript** Developers](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/Hy9V41oU8)
- [Technical Questions - **RxJS** + State Managmeent](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/ByP6VJs88)
- [Technical Questions - **Angular** Developers](https://hackmd.io/@OcuX4lIATSKhG1FiExkhQQ/S1qVm1s8L)
- [Technical Questions - **React** Developers](https://hackmd.io/B3Nx43qkTJmEJ_Q7EZ9HFw)
- Technical Questions - **Java** Developers
- Technical Questions - **QA** Engineers

Interviewers should use the candidate's responses to evaluate a ranking.

> These 'interview' rankings should be compared with the candidate's self-assessment rankings.

Additionally the candidate behavioral responses to the technical questions should be noted:

- Does the candidate attempt to bluff, do they give up... or do they ask for more information ?
- Does the candidate get angry or defensive ?
- Is the candidate able to explore new areas with some success (even with guidance)?
- Is the candidate able to learn quickly?
- Can the candidate take verbal answers and apply them in code ?
  <br />

### 3) 'Onsite' Behavioral Interview

The onsite visit is the opportunity to evaluate the communication and collaborative nature of the candidate. This last phase of the interview actually has two (2) sections:

- Behavioral & Career Questions
- Mob Programming (optional)

<br />

#### Avoid Whiteboarding Questions!

<Image src={`/static/images/technical-interviews/83tSSjz.png`} alt={``} width={1422} height={674} />

:::danger
This cannot be emphasized enough! **Whiteboard** questions are useless, demeaning, and do not provide an assessment for productivity.
:::

<br />

#### Behavioral Interviews

This part of the interview allows the candidate to be assessed for interest in onboarding, passion for their work, ability to communicate, and demeanor with others.

<Image src={`/static/images/technical-interviews/9RlYYRe.png`} alt={``} width={1678} height={610} />

<br />

Questions can include:

- Have you ever been a team lead?
- What was your biggest challenge with your lat project?
- What was your biggest success with your last project?
- What is your area that you feel you excell at?
- What are your weak areas ?
- Have you mentored other developers?
- Have you ever done software architecture?
